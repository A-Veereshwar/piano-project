# Piano-Project
### This is a virtual piano built using html, css and javaScript.  
This project let's you play piano using corresponding keys on your keyboard or even you can interact with it using mouse clicks/screen clicks (if it's a mobile).  
I created a new branch to elimate a bug so now this works even when **caps lock** is **on**, enchanced the User Interface, made the site responsive.  

### Enjoy your piano music..
